## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Relate wave height, chamber pressure differential, and turbine airflow to conversion efficiency in an OWC device.
- **Methods**: Bench-scale OWC rig, pressure & wave probes, time‑series analysis (filtering, statistics), efficiency calculation.
- **Deliverables**: Pressure–wave plots, efficiency curves, discussion of losses and turbine loading.

## How to Use

1. Open `report/OWC_Experiment_Report.pdf` for methodology and results.
2. Export your raw measurements (CSV) to `data/` (e.g., `owc_run1.csv`).
3. Add analysis scripts in `code/` (MATLAB `.m` or Python `.py`) to reproduce plots.
4. Save figures (PNG) into `figures/` and reference them from this README.
